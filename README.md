\\ ok bois im not suffering while making this, right? \\
probably.

most of these are by me. some arent. be aware. almost all of them have been coded with js/javascript.

about the owner: his name is jakob. shocking. if you do not know how to add bookmarklets to your bookmarks bar or to a folder, get out of my github page. the sole purpose why youre here is to get bookmarklets, not to search up how to get them.
